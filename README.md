Imagine being given the following problem at a technical interview to solve using a heap.

There are several network cables of different lengths, and you need to connect them two at a time into one cable using connectors in the order that will result in the lowest cost. The cost of connecting two cables is equal to the sum of their lengths, and the total cost is equal to the sum of the cables connected.

The problem is finding the connection order that minimizes the total cost.
